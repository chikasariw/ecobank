# 🌿 EcoBank

**EcoBank** is a web-based digital platform that acts as a bridge between users and inorganic waste managers. With EcoBank, users can exchange their recyclable (inorganic) waste immediately without having to accumulate it in large quantities first. Our goal is to make the recycling process easier, more accessible, and increase environmental awareness.
